/* Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
 */

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  for (let i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {
      if (b[i] === a[j]) {
        a.splice(j, 1);
        j = j - 1;
      }
    }
  }

  return a;

console.log(arrayDiff([1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 6, 9, 3, 6], [2, 6, 9]));
